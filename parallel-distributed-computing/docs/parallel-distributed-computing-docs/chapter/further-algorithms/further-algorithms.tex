    \begin{section}{Parallel Sum}
        \par The project includes additional modules not part of the presented submissions, such as two parallel summation algorithms: \textbf{Ringsum} and \textbf{Cascadesum}.
        \par The latter is more efficient with respect to time complexity, requiring only $\log_2(P)$ steps for message passing, as opposed to $P - 1$, where $P$ denotes the number of processes involved.

    \begin{section}{MatMatThread}
        \par The MatMatThread implemented algorithm is \glsxtrshort{summa}.
