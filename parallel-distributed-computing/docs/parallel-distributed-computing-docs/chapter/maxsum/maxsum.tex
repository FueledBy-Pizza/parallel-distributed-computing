    \begin{section}{Problem at a glance}
        \par Given a matrix, the objective is to identify the row with the highest squared root sum.

    \begin{section}{Algorithm}
        \begin{subsection}{Parallelization}
            \par The algorithm employs a multithreaded approach, each thread can compute indipendently its local maximum squared root. Once a thread has completed its task, a synchronization is needed with the other threads in order to determine the overall maximum squared root.

        \begin{subsection}{Pseudocode}
            Input:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item matrix
                \item number of thread(s) for parallel execution
            \end{itemize}
            Steps:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Assign rows to threads.
                \item For each thread:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Compute the local maximum squared root sum.
                \end{enumerate}
                \item Return the overall maximum squared root sum among all threads.
            \end{enumerate}
