    \begin{section}{Problem at a glance}
        \par Given a matrix, the objective is to compute the squared root sum of the elements in each row and identify the maximum squared root sum among these row sums.
    \end{section}
    \begin{section}{Algorithm}
        \begin{subsection}{Parallelization}
            \par The algorithm adopts a multithread solution.
        \end{subsection}
        \begin{subsection}{Pseudocode}
            \par Every thread gets the whole matrix as input (even if the thread needs only a part of it) and the number of threads to run in parallel.
            \par Steps:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Assign rows to threads.
                \item Compute the maximum squared root sum for each thread.
                \item Return the maximum squared root sum among all threads.
            \end{enumerate}
