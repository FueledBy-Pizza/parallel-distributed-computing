        \par Supercomputing is a way to solve a problem by using a supercomputer. The term "supercomputer" refers to a system that provides the most high performances, in that exact moment ("that moment" is specified because, as history has taught, today's enhanced technology is tomorrow's ordinary/outdated tool\footnote{In 80s, Cray 1 (100 Mflops) performed a calculation in one year. Nowadays (2023), the same calculation is performed in less than \SI{2}{\micro\second} by Frontier (1.6 Eflops)}). Performance is measured by the needed time to solve a particular application.
