		\texttt{main.c} Supercomputing is a way to solve a problem by using a supercomputer. The term "supercomputer" refers to a system that provides the most high performances, in that exact moment ("that moment" is specified because, as history has taught, today's enhanced technology is tomorrow's ordinary/outdated tool\footnote{In 80s, Cray 1 (100 Mflops) performed a calculation in one year. Nowadays (2023), the same calculation is performed in less than \SI{2}{\micro\second} by Frontier (1.6 Eflops)}). Performance is measured by the needed time to solve a particular application.

	\begin{section}{Goal}
		\par This document provides a comprehensive overview of a project developed in \texttt{C}, consisting of multiple modules delivered in incremental phases. The purpose of the project is to experiment parallel computing techniques and occasionally exploiting \glsxtrlong{hpc}.
	\end{section}
	\begin{section}{Environment}
		\par The project was entirely developed on a macOS system, with the help of Xcode \glsxtrshort{ide}.
	\end{section}
	\begin{section}{TBD}
		\par Most parts of the \texttt{main.c} files are provided by the project supervisor.
